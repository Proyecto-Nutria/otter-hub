## Code style
The project is written in Typescript, we sill use camel case for the variables, tabs as ident character and for more than 4 arguments we better think on separate the function into smaller pieces or define a type that will be contain the necessary information. All of this and more would be defined on a eslint and prettier and other code style plugins that would help us complain with the code style.
